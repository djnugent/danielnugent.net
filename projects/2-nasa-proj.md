## TL;DR
Summer of 2017 I interned at NASA JPL. While at NASA I worked in the Micro Aerial Vehicle(MAV) Laboratory. My project was to improve autonomous positioning of a quadrotor during landing. The platform I was working on needed to land on small elevated surfaces like free standing walls or corners of rooftops.

## My role

I can't talk about the project in too much detail but my role involved:
- Flight testing
- Automated Flight Analysis
- PID Tuning
- Online PID Tuning
- Position Controller Design
- Integration of Visual Inertial Odometry(SSF/SVO)

My main contribution to the team was using development, testing, and analysis to extract the best flight performance out of the system.
