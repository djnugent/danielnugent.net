## TL;DR
The goal was to create an internet connected Polaroid printer that prints photos shortly after they are posted to my Instagram feed. With everything being digital it is rare to see printed pictures. This allows me to print my favorite photos without even thinking about it.

## Parts:
Polaroid Bluetooth Pogo printer
Intel Edison

## Services:
Instagram API

## Areas of Improvement:
Currently this printer operates as a background service. I would like to create a website which allows you to configure how the photos print, reprint old photos, and display any errors. I have very little webdev experience so this could take some time to make it look nice.

## Code
All code can be found on my [github](https://github.com/djnugent/instaprinter)
