I spent roughly 6 months my sophomore year consulting for Japan Drones(head of the ArduCopter Project). My project was to use visual navigation onboard a multirotor UAV to land on a target. The current capabilities of GPS guided UAVâ€™s only allow for meter accuracy. Implementing visual navigation will allow for cm accuracy. The project utilizes a micro linux computer, Python, OpenCV, and APM:Copter. The software is open source. More info can be found [here](precland-proj.html)!

I consulted for Chris Anderson(CEO of 3DRobotics) on a self driving go kart project with Carl Bass(CEO of Autodesk). The goal was to make a go kart race autonomously. I helped configure the initial GPS autopilot, and started initial development on a computer vision autopilot. Below you can see an example of my work.
