## TL;DR
Spring semester of my sophomore year I lead a team of 4 to create an app/program for a sophomore design class. The project had to include a user interface, have network connectivity, allow for multiple users, and have an admin. Our group decided to make an android app called Phocal. Phocal stands for photo-local and allows users to anonymously post photos to their current city. It is equivalent to a location based Instagram with anonymous users.

## My Role
During the project I worked on app side networking, server side networking, admin page, and code architecture. The project revolved around project management. Key topics included: Developing use cases, creating timelines, and defining project specs.

## The Outcome
At the end of the semester our team was awarded the Best Software Engineering Award â€“ It was chosen by the TAs and based on team work and effort put throughout the semester. We competed with 34 other teams for this award. The only other award above us was the Best Project which was chosen by popular vote.
