# Rockwell Collins

![cockpit](img/projects/rockwell-cockpit.jpg)

Over the summer of 2014 I interned as a Software Engineer at Rockwell Collins in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. I worked in the Commercial Flight Controls department. My project was to streamline the process of taking flight characteristics of an aircraft from the manufacturer and converting into a form comparable with the flight controllers.

The goal of the project was to make this process more lean and reduce Rockwell Collins labor hours. During the project I analyzed the process, identified weak points, and generated alternative process approaches.
