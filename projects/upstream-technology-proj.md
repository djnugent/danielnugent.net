## Upstream Technologies

![boards](img/projects/upstream.jpg)

The summer of 2013 I did contract Electrical Engineering work for Upstream Technologies. My project was to prototype a digital infiltrometer. The device is to used to measure characteristics of soil when making a foundation. My goal was to automate this manual test through the use of sensors and a microcontroller.

The project involved designing the circuit, PCB layout, and programming the microcontroller. The projects went through 3 revisions by end of my contract.
